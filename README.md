# Team Chill Bankje

We proudly introduce "Fight Streeter", a revolutionizing way to play one-to-one fighting games. In Fight Streeter, we've given the player
the task to physically perform the actions himself to defeat his enemy. With the motion-tracking technique of the Kinect, we're able
to track the player's movement and let his character follow these movements. Along this we've added a machine learning A.I. for a more
challenging solo battle, and a dynamic sound engine that sets the music and loudness according to sircumstances like the amount of health.

Now we know not everyone owns a Kinect. So to make our game as compatible as we can, we've also given the possibility to control 
the character with a controller or keyboard. In this mode, the player will control a character with a pre-determined set of moves, just
like regular fighting games.
